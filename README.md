# Big-Data-and-AI-in-Operation-Management---Non-Financial-Dataset-Project
Exploratory Analysis &amp; Forecasting on monthly time series of the birth rate per day in Spain

## Overview
This project analyzes a **real-world non-financial time series dataset** to identify trends, seasonality, and temporal patterns, and to generate **data-driven forecasts**.  
The objective is to apply classical time series models and evaluate their performance using statistical diagnostics.

## Objectives
- Explore temporal patterns (trend, seasonality)
- Apply and compare time series models
- Select optimal models using statistical criteria
- Generate and interpret forecasts
- Translate statistical results into practical insights

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Statsmodels (ARMA, ARIMA, Seasonal ARIMA)

## Analysis Performed
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Trend and seasonality detection
- Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation analysis (ACF / PACF)
- Model fitting (ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA)
- Model comparison using AIC / BIC
- Residual diagnostics
- In-sample and out-of-sample forecasting

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Applying classical time series models to real data
- Model selection and parameter tuning
- Interpreting residual diagnostics
- Evaluating forecast accuracy
- Communicating time series results clearly

## Notes
- Dataset is non-financial and publicly available
- Analysis performed for academic purposes
- Focus is on interpretability and model evaluation, not deep learning
